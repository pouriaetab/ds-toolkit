# DS-Toolkit

Welcome to the `ds-toolkit`, a curated collection of introductory topics on some of the most commonly used statistical methods, machine learning models, and an introduction to Natural Language Processing (NLP) in one accessible location. This resource is intended for data scientists, and researchers, providing a broad range of examples and implementations to facilitate learning and application in data analysis and predictive modeling and beyond.

## Description

This repository is organized into directories that cater to distinct areas of data science. Each directory is dedicated to specific areas within the field, such as statistical methods, machine learning algorithms, and foundational NLP concepts. Contained within these directories are Jupyter Notebooks that offer hands-on examples and detailed implementations designed to demonstrate the techniques in a clear and practical manner.

### Contents

- [**`statistical_methods`**](./statistical_methods/): For detailed information on the contents of this directory, please refer to the [`README.md`](./statistical_methods/README.md) file within the [`statistical_methods`](./statistical_methods/) folder. It covers a wide array of statistical concepts from basic to advanced levels, providing examples in Jupyter Notebooks.

## Getting Started

To dive into the `ds-toolkit`, clone this repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/pouriaetab/ds-toolkit.git
```

Navigate through the repository directories to explore the statistical methods provided.

### Prerequisites

The notebooks are designed to run in environments that support `.ipynb` files, such as Jupyter Notebooks/Lab or Visual Studio Code. Dependencies and libraries required for each notebook are specified within the notebooks themselves, allowing users to install necessary packages via `pip` or `conda`.

## How to Use

1. Select a directory of interest, such as one within `statistical_methods/`.
2. Open the Jupyter Notebooks in your preferred environment.
3. Follow the examples provided in the notebooks, and feel free to modify the code or apply the techniques to your own data.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! If you'd like to add new examples, enhance existing content, or suggest new topics, please feel free to make a pull request or open an issue.
