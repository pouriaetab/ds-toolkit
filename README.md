# Stats-ML-Toolkit

Welcome to the `stats-ml-toolkit`, a comprehensive repository aimed at consolidating the most commonly used statistical methods and machine learning models in one accessible location. This resource is intended for data scientists, and researchers, providing a broad range of examples and implementations to facilitate learning and application in data analysis and predictive modeling fields.

## Description

This repository is organized into directories that cater to distinct areas of statistical methods, with a plan to expand into machine learning models. Each directory contains Jupyter Notebooks that illustrate various techniques through simple practical examples.

### Contents

- **`statistical_methods/`**: For detailed information on the contents of this directory, please refer to the `README.md` file within the `statistical_methods` folder. It covers a wide array of statistical concepts from basic to advanced levels, providing examples in Jupyter Notebooks.

## Getting Started

To dive into the `stats-ml-toolkit`, clone this repository to your local machine:

[git clone https://github.com/pouriaetab/stats-ml-toolkit.git](git clone https://github.com/pouriaetab/stats-ml-toolkit.git)


Navigate through the repository directories to explore the statistical methods provided.

### Prerequisites

The notebooks are designed to run in environments that support `.ipynb` files, such as Jupyter Notebooks/Lab or Visual Studio Code. Dependencies and libraries required for each notebook are specified within the notebooks themselves, allowing users to install necessary packages via `pip` or `conda`.

## How to Use

1. Select a directory of interest, such as one within `statistical_methods/`.
2. Open the Jupyter Notebooks in your preferred environment.
3. Follow the examples provided in the notebooks, and feel free to modify the code or apply the techniques to your own data.
