    "# Estimation (Point) in Inferential Statistics\n",
    "\n",
    "Estimation is a fundamental concept in inferential statistics, used to make predictions or inferences about a population based on sample data. Point estimation involves using sample data to calculate a single value (known as a point estimate) that serves as the best estimate of an unknown population parameter (e.g., population mean, population proportion).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Mathematical Formula\n",
    "\n",
    "The formula for estimating the population mean ($\\mu$) using the sample mean ($\\bar{x}$) is:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\bar{x} = \\frac{1}{n}\\sum_{i=1}^{n}x_i$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $n$ is the sample size, and $x_i$ are the individual sample values.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Explanation of Steps\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Collect a Sample**: Randomly select a sample of $n$ observations from the population.\n",
    "2. **Calculate the Sample Mean**: Use the sample data to calculate the sample mean ($\\bar{x}$), which serves as the point estimate of the population mean ($\\mu$).\n",
    "3. **Use the Sample Mean as the Point Estimate**: The calculated sample mean is used as the best estimate of the population mean.\n",

    "#### Business Scenario: Estimating Average Daily Active Users in a Software Application\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine you're a data analyst at a software technology company, and you're tasked with estimating the average daily active users (DAU) for a new application. The company has launched the app recently, and you want to estimate the average DAU to forecast server load and guide marketing strategies.\n",
    "\n",
    "To accomplish this, you decide to collect data on the daily active users for a sample of 30 days after the app's launch.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Python Code Example\n",
    "\n",
    "The following Python code demonstrates how to perform point estimation for this scenario using a randomly created pandas DataFrame to simulate the sample data of daily active users.\n"

    "# Hypothesis Testing in Inferential Statistics\n",
    "\n",
    "Hypothesis testing is a pivotal method in inferential statistics that enables decision-making based on data analysis.

By analyzing sample data, we determine the likelihood of the null hypothesis being true.\n",

    "#### Business Scenario: Impact of a New Treatment on Billing Amounts for Hypertension Patients\n",
    "\n",
    "In this scenario, our healthcare facility has introduced a new treatment protocol for hypertension. We aim to assess whether this new treatment has led to a change in the billing amounts for patients diagnosed with hypertension. To do this, we will compare the billing amounts before and after the introduction of the new treatment.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Steps for Hypothesis Testing\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Formulate Hypotheses**:\n",
    "   - Null Hypothesis ($H_0$): The new treatment has no effect on the billing amounts for hypertension patients.\n",
    "   - Alternative Hypothesis ($H_1$): The new treatment significantly changes the billing amounts for hypertension patients.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Select an Appropriate Test**:\n",
    "   Assuming we have data on billing amounts for a similar number of patients before and after the treatment's introduction, a two-sample T-test (for independent samples) could be appropriate. If the billing amounts are paired (e.g., the same patients before and after treatment), a paired T-test would be more suitable.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Determine the Significance Level ($\\alpha$)**:\n",
    "   Typically, a significance level of 0.05 is used.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Calculate the Test Statistic and P-value**:\n",
    "   This involves calculating the mean billing amount before and after the treatment and using the selected T-test to compute the p-value.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Make a Decision**:\n",
    "   If the p-value is less than the significance level, we reject the null hypothesis, suggesting the new treatment has a significant effect on billing amounts.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Python Implementation\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is a simplified Python example using hypothetical data. You'll need to adjust this to fit the actual structure of your dataset and specifically filter for 'Hypertension' patients before and after the treatment introduction."

    "The T-statistic and P-value are key components in interpreting the results of a hypothesis test. The T-statistic, in this case, is -0.0789, which indicates the direction and magnitude of the difference between the mean billing amounts before and after the treatment. However, the magnitude here is very small, suggesting a minimal difference between the two means.\n",
    "\n",
    "The P-value of 0.9371 is much higher than the commonly used significance level of 0.05. In hypothesis testing, a P-value greater than the significance level leads us to fail to reject the null hypothesis. In this context, the null hypothesis posits that there is no significant difference in the billing amounts before and after the introduction of the new treatment for hypertension.\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, based on the P-value obtained, we conclude that there is not enough statistical evidence to suggest that the new treatment had a significant effect on the billing amounts for patients with hypertension. The slight difference observed in the mean billing amounts before and after the treatment is not statistically significant.\n",
    "\n",
    "This interpretation implies that, from a billing perspective, the new treatment does not appear to impact the cost of care for hypertension patients in a meaningful way. It's important to note that this analysis focuses solely on billing amounts and does not address the clinical effectiveness or patient outcomes related to the new treatment. Further studies may be necessary to evaluate the treatment's effectiveness and other impacts on patient care beyond just the financial aspect"
