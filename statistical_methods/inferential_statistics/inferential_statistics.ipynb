    "# Estimation (Point) in Inferential Statistics\n",
    "\n",
    "Estimation is a fundamental concept in inferential statistics, used to make predictions or inferences about a population based on sample data. Point estimation involves using sample data to calculate a single value (known as a point estimate) that serves as the best estimate of an unknown population parameter (e.g., population mean, population proportion).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Mathematical Formula\n",
    "\n",
    "The formula for estimating the population mean ($\\mu$) using the sample mean ($\\bar{x}$) is:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\bar{x} = \\frac{1}{n}\\sum_{i=1}^{n}x_i$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $n$ is the sample size, and $x_i$ are the individual sample values.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Explanation of Steps\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Collect a Sample**: Randomly select a sample of $n$ observations from the population.\n",
    "2. **Calculate the Sample Mean**: Use the sample data to calculate the sample mean ($\\bar{x}$), which serves as the point estimate of the population mean ($\\mu$).\n",
    "3. **Use the Sample Mean as the Point Estimate**: The calculated sample mean is used as the best estimate of the population mean.\n",

    "#### Business Scenario: Estimating Average Daily Active Users in a Software Application\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine you're a data analyst at a software technology company, and you're tasked with estimating the average daily active users (DAU) for a new application. The company has launched the app recently, and you want to estimate the average DAU to forecast server load and guide marketing strategies.\n",
    "\n",
    "To accomplish this, you decide to collect data on the daily active users for a sample of 30 days after the app's launch.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Python Code Example\n",
    "\n",
    "The following Python code demonstrates how to perform point estimation for this scenario using a randomly created pandas DataFrame to simulate the sample data of daily active users.\n"
